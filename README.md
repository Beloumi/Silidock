Silidock
========

simple lightweight dockbar


Author: Axel von dem Bruch


This is a preliminary test version.

Silidock is a simple dockbar, available for Linux and Windows, written in C++, using the FLTK toolkit. 
It can be configured using two scripts: one script for adding and removing applications, the other to set size, position, columns and date display. 

The folder "imgs" contains the button images and must be in the same directory. 

This program follows the principle of "keep it simple". It does nothing but launch applications via button click, except (optional) displays date and time. And there is no intention to extend the functionality in the future. 


ToDos:
- Test this version on different Linux and Windows platforms. 
- Test especially for Fluxbox, E17... 
- Migrate to FreeBSD and maybe other BSDs. 
In the future: 
- Make it easier to use: replace scripts for configuration, Windows: extract images from .exe files.

You can find (insufficiently tested) binaries there.
