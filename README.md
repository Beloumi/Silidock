simple lightweight dockbar

Version 0.1
This is a preliminary test version.
Author: Axel von dem Bruch

Silidock is a simple dockbar, available for Linux and Windows, written in C++, using the FLTK toolkit. 
It can be configured using two scripts: one script for adding and removing applications, the other to set size, position, columns and date display. 

This program follows the principle of "keep it simple". It does nothing but launch applications via button click, except (optional) displays date and time. And there is no intention to extend the functionality in the future. 

Currently, only binaries are available for download and they are not even adequately tested. 

ToDos:
- Test this version on different Linux and Windows platforms. 
- Test especially for Fluxbox, E17... 
- Migrate to FreeBSD and maybe other BSDs. 
In the future: 
- Make it easier to use: replace scripts for configuration, Windows: extract images from .exe files.
